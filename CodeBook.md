# Variables and Process

* `xTrain`, `yTrain`, `xTest`, `yTest`, `subjectTrain`, `activityType`, `features` and `subjectTest` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `trainingData` and `testData` combines the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `finalData` combines `trainingData` and `testData` in a big dataset. After that, it is merged with `activityType`
* Finally, `tidyData` contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a `.txt` file.
